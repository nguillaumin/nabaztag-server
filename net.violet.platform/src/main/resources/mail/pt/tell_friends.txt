FIRST_NAME has asked us to let you know that they have entered a whole new phase of their life: they arte now part of the Internet of Things. 
 
FIRST_NAME has connected this to the network:
USER_OBJECTS
 
Connecting things to the Internet gives them the capacity to provide information, render interactive services, make everyday life easier and communicate with the rest of the world. 
 
You will be able to communicate with FIRST_NAME through one of the objects on their network. You will discover innovative new ways of sending messages - rich, spectacular, amazing, relevant and contextual. 
 
So don’t delay – go to www.violet.net and set up an account. It’s fast, it’s free.  You will then be able to send messages to FIRST_NAME’s objects and to other friends who own connected things. 
 
Does this world of communicating objects sound a little weird to you? Check out the www.violet.net website and find out more about the Internet’s ultimate evolution: it’s no longer just computers that can connect to the network, it’s any other object too!
 
Welcome to the Internet of Things.
